## 📦 Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes customer reviews from Amazon using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, and generate actionable business insights based on customer sentiment.

# 📊 Objectives
🧹 Clean and preprocess Amazon review data

📈 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🤖 Build and evaluate sentiment classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Naive Bayes

Gradient Boosting

# 📊 Visualize trends and insights using Power BI

🧪 Models & Evaluation
Each model was evaluated using the following standard metrics:

✅ Accuracy

🎯 Precision

🔁 Recall

📉 F1-Score

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming: Python

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy
